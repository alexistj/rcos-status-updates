## Last Week's Accomplishments
I had an excused absence to attend the Grace Hopper conference, so I couldn't work on the project this week.

## This Week's Plan

Try to map out/ draft a UI for the sorter program and learn out to apply it
## Anything Blocking?

Since I have no experience in creating a UI, making it for this project will be difficult so, I might need to ask for addtional help. What I would like to do is create a interface that make the slider's title more readable.

## Notes

At the conference I went to a workshop explaining how machine learning works, at a top level. From that, I think that the sorter could benefit from more images or test from diffent samples, based on color, size, and contours.
