## Last Week's Accomplishments

Found all the packages that are needed to use the sorter like numpy pip, and more, and designed how I want the application to look like, having a more user friendly interface by having a more descriptive definition of the slider options.




## This Week's Plan

Update the documentation with the needed packages, and how to access/use them and details of what the camera output means.


## Anything Blocking?

Our gitHub page hasn't been showing some pushes we had made on Sunday. We confirmed it was pushed because I was able to pull, but it just didn't show up on the github page.
