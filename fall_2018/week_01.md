## Last Week's Accomplishments

Got PyCharm and github/git set up.

## This Week's Plan

Ask about the display we will be using for the sorter, and understand how to modify the rasberry pi with the packages we need without causing erros.

## Anything Blocking?

I need to see the demo run more so I can properly document how to run it on the terminal line, then apply a UI.
