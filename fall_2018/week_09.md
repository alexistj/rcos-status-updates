## Last Week's Accomplishments
The display for the rasberry is working! The numpy is installed and asking in the rcos-help desk, I learned that we need to have pip3 to fix some of out set up problems. Pip3 is still being a bit difficult to download though.(we somehow got every other version of pip besides 3.) 

## This Week's Plan


Get pip3 to work so we can finish the installtion for the semester then once we figure out everything, document the steps so no one will have to spend a long time to figure out installation. 


## Anything Blocking?
The pip3 package is blocking the path, we were given instruction but there has been an error involing a unicorn package which is strange because the unicorn package from what we researched had to do with led lights which had nothing to do with the packages we are trying to download.
