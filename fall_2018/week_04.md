## Last Week's Accomplishments

Found all the packages that are needed to use the sorter, and designed how I want the application to look like.




## This Week's Plan

Update the documentation with the needed packages, and how to access/use them.


## Anything Blocking?

Our gitHub page hasn't been showing some pushes we had made on Sunday. We confirmed it was pushed because I was able to pull, but it just didn't show up on the github page.

## Notes
