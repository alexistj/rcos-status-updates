## Last Week's Accomplishments

Started to get an explanation for the hardware that is being built so It will be easier for me to document it. 


## This Week's Plan

Ask more detailed questions about the program for documentation.


## Anything Blocking?
On the hardware side, we are having trouble with getting pieces 3-D printed and the motor are not the most efficient but they work
