## Last Week's Accomplishments
Because of the whole group having projects, homework, and exams around this time we have not accomplished anything towards the project.
## This Week's Plan
With this semester coming to an end, we will all be preparing for final exams, project and such. Next Semester's plan will include, working more on the hardware concept for the fossil sorter and solving the bugs with Rpi. In terms of what we have done this semester, we have documented most of the functions and how to run and install the program on a PC, created a 1st prototype of the conveyer belt, and tinkered with new machine learning methods
