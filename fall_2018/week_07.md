## Last Week's Accomplishments
Documented all the functions, in new man format, needed to use the program. Prepared RCOS presentaion, and documented the first prototype of the hardware pieces. Hardware is a WIP.

## This Week's Plan
Get ready for RCOS presentation by meeting up with teammates and present the slides multiple times.

## Anything Blocking?
Been having problems trying to get the camera to switch, even though in the program parameters have the different camera number, so after teh presentation, I plan on debugging the issue.
