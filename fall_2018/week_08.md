## Last Week's Accomplishments

Since most of the documentation has been done. Progress on installing the program on a Rpi has started. We have been trying to install the packages listed in the HowTo.txt but are having problems, with certain ones, like numpy and pip. We have been using online tutorials and testing them when we meet.




## This Week's Plan

Figure out why we can't download the python packages, and get the Rpi display to work. When we adjourn, from our meetings and still have a problem, look for resources to resolve the issues. 


## Anything Blocking?

When we try to install numpy it gives us an error message and when we try to install pip it says we have it install, and when we go back to numpy it gives us the error that pip is needed to download the package.
