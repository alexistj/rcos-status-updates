## Last Week's Accomplishments
I have pushed a HowTo txt on how to run the live demo through IDE and terminal. This is a short how to and will be worked on more.
## This Week's Plan

Try to work on UI draft using python GUI. I understand how to work with tktinke but I find the interface not the best looking, so I would like to use another package to maybe come up with a better syle.

## Anything Blocking?

I need to research commands for pyhon GUI and complety understand how the live demo works in order to productively make edits.
## Notes
