## Last Week's Accomplishments
Started the implenting the Mongo Db code into Swift, but didn't push due to a conversation we had. Had a conversation of adding a new branch to the app, Group Ride Web, because it will be useful for adapting to different devices, and myself and other members are more familar with web devolpment compared to swift and java apps. During this we will branch databases Firebase and Mongo and test which works best for our project overall.


## This Week's Plan

Start with creating the static html pages, with bootstrap, displaying the messaging board, login, about page, register page and etc. We will be working in https://github.com/zdward/GroupRideWeb/ . I have been working in the Server branch and will continue to work there. Hopefully later working on the backend with the node to route pages.

## Anything Blocking?
