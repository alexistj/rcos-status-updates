## Last Week's Accomplishments
Completed the linked tutorial from the last status update. From the group database I was able to see the data being uploaded and get a better understanding of the code. However Mongo DB atlus is somewhat new so that tutorial was the most of a lead that I could use to figure out how to use it, but they have a great slack community and a channel base soley on atlus. I have asked a question on how to intregrate the tutorial to our project but I haven't gotten a response yet.


## This Week's Plan

Start implenting the mongo connection code into xcode files for IoS app. First download packages, then navigate to the views pages and per text box take their values and enter it into the database. 


## Anything Blocking?

There has been a debate on contining with Firebase vs Mongo. Another member debug the issue with Firebase on the Ios side but not the Andoroid side.But if we want consitant data we need to use the same DB. We have started to branch off towards using the different DBs and seeing what works.
