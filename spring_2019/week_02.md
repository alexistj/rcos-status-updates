## Last Week's Accomplishments

After debugging some issue in the repository, I discovered that it is good practice to create a gitignore file, with 
Xcode when working with teams, to avoid issue with the workspaces that are generated differently on different devices.
This was a the main cause of our issue. I also made sure to document any errors I discovered like when trying to create a build, but there are errors with the Firebase import.

## This Week's Plan

My goal is to create the messaging hub using firebases, database system.  For now I want the app to register sessions after a user logs in so, the app can send post and recieve post by sending different queries to our database.  This will require me to start learning more in depth Swift, so  I can at least display a simple layout for said messages.
## Anything Blocking?
