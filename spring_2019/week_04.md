## Last Week's Accomplishments

Added some further documentation on the firebase branch of group ride ios, because there was confusion on how to 1, set up cocoa pods to retrived needed modules, and 2 run the ios app on their local devices because xcode gives an error message if you run in on the playground, but not in the workspace. 

## This Week's Plan

My goal is to fully implement the database with the ios app by adding queries to the database after a user registers, to insert. After they register they should be able to login with the same infomation by making another query find query to the database and be able to hold a session for posting rides and such.
## Anything Blocking?

Having issue on the andorid side with firebase so new database may need to be used. Base on lessons for web science class myself and another member were leaning toward MongoDB Atlus because we will all be able to access it because the db is in the cloud and Mongo is a bit better for things that require fast reponse messages.
