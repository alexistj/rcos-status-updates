## Last Week's Accomplishments

I created a group Gmail to start our FireBase Database. While everyone was pushing a pulling on the master branch there was an error which cause everyone who pulled from the repository files to corrupt I found out was an error in file naming which caused Xcode to change the directory paths of what objects to use when trying to make a build, run the code. The only fix for this was to force push an older version of the repository, which while it did halt progress a little, it was best that it happend early rather than later. 

## This Week's Plan

My goal is to try get the firebase database connected to the app, document how to use it, and fix the bugs that may happen on the master branch and document those errors so if it happens on other people's computers there is a solution to try. I will be working on a seperate branch from master, so when I pulled again from master and somethings don't configure, I will have to spend time fixing the problems and documenting them. All documentation on this is on the firebase branch.
## Anything Blocking?

I still need to learn the syntax of firebase.
