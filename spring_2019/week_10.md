## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we talked about what direction the web group should go for next semester and possible goals. We stressed the issue of creating proper documentation for the node js parts of the project so that others can catch on faster. Add on the read me such as how to download the proper technolgies, npm and node, install the packages, and set up the mongo db atlus accounts.

## This Week's Plan


Finish up on what we can on the backend, such as routing the linked pages, filling out some documentation for setup of node npm and localhost server, and a base for connecting to the mongo db server, to post and get information. Also make sure our presentation and other objects are turned in for grading.
