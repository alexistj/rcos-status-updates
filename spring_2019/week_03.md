## Last Week's Accomplishments

I had started a draft of the messaging system , like the general data structure of the object, a page to display and allow new post, and a rating system for the message, until the use of in depth profile pages, and replys to messages are created.s

## This Week's Plan

I want to start testing my draft to make sure it can push and pull post, register login sessions while the user is on the app before I merge with master. I want to test this system well, so I will ask my team members to run the app on their devices. Doing this will evaluate where is the point where the firebase server starts to slow, at that point we can limit get and post request per minute to the database.
## Anything Blocking?
