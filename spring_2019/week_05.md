## Last Week's Accomplishments

After trying to fix the firebase issues with Andoroid, we decided it may be time to try a different database because we had many previous issue with firebase 



## This Week's Plan

My goal is to create the messaging hub using firebases, database system.  For now I want the app to register sessions after a user logs in so, the app can send post and recieve post by sending different queries to our database.  This will require me to start learning more in depth Swift, so  I can at least display a simple layout for said messages.
## Anything Blocking?
