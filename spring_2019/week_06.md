## Last Week's Accomplishments
So for this week we have decided to switch over to testing Mongo DB atlus because of the issue with Firebase on the Android side. Andorid app was unable to connect to the Google Firebase website which verified the app to use the DB. I sat down with the other person working on it but we could not figure out why the app and DB weren't connecting. The app code wa correct and we followed the directions as documented by the website.


## This Week's Plan


Read Mongo Db atlus documentation for Swift and try to connect the app with the database and collections that I will make for Group Ride. First, I will try to follow the tutorials given by Mongo DB Atlus on how to use the app with the DB. Link to tutorial: https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/guides/todo-ios/ . Hopefully by completing this I will be able to for the most part understand how the mongodb stitch package interacts with mongo db atlus.

## Anything Blocking?

May take a bit to understand the syntax and how to modify code with current views created, and merge my changes with others.
