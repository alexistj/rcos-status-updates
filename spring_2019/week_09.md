## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week the web app group was able to create a great static page using boostrap that includes a nav bar, about us , register, log in, profile and draft of the post page with some dummy data for effects. This gives us a good base to start working with the mongo database to run the api calls recreate to make the registation and login. We will be using a collection for users and a seperate collection for ride post.

## This Week's Plan


Prepare for our presenation by doing a dry run of the demo and speech. Create our slides and make sure they follow the directions on what content should be in the presenation. Refine some of the front end of the web app of groupRide such as the profile html.
